# Image-denoising-autoencoder


# 🖼️ Image-denoising-autoencoder

A deep learning image denoising application using a U-Net autoencoder with interactive noise and clarity controls. Effortlessly clean up noisy images with a modern UI powered by Gradio.

---

## 📚 Introduction

**Image-denoising-autoencoder** leverages a U-Net based autoencoder architecture to remove noise from images. With an intuitive Gradio interface, users can upload images, adjust noise and clarity levels in real-time, and visualize the denoising results instantly. This project is ideal for students, researchers, and developers interested in image processing, autoencoders, and interactive AI demos.
